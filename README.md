# Manning Dashboard
### This project will only be worked on as time allows.
## Objective
Provide a manning dashboard to show current manpower levels across the Wing.
### Requirements
- Web based UI
- SQL database
- Read in from Unit Manning Document (UMD) and Unit Personnel Manning Roster (UPMR) so data isn't constantly hand-jammed.
- Maintain integrity of all PII during development process
### Other
The UMD and UPMR are entirely PII. If you need them to see what raw data you are working with, contact SSgt Goldstein.
