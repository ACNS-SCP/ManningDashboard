### SSgt Goldstein's Take
This project is an extracurricular project established with <b>training</b> in mind. You aren't expected to know SQL, HTML, CSS, etc. right off the bat but the only way to learn is to read it and try it. This would be a great, unclassified example of something that you could use to show a potential employer of your abilities. Doing this part by part will make it easier for you to grasp the concepts. <B>Additionally, I'd like to see teamwork here.</B> Up until now, we've been doing a bunch of projects as individuals. This would be a great opportunity to develop something as a team.
### Other
The UMD and UPMR are entirely <B>PII</B>. When you are ready for them to see what raw data you are working with, contact SSgt Goldstein.

Any questions or comments can go to SSgt Goldstein or SSgt McQuillan. Should you choose to take on this project, send one of us a mock up of your UI and your design before you get started.
